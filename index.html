     <p>I have many years of experience as a Wordpress Web Developer. I am currently self-employed and the owner of Insignis Web, a Web Development and Graphic Design/Branding business based in County Limerick. I hold a Bachelors Degree (Hons) in Environmental Science & Technology (H2.1) (Level 8) from Sligo Institute of Technology. I believe I hold all of the prerequisites for this course and I am very interested. Previous to my self-employment, I worked for many years in the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing sector as an employee.</p>

        <p>I have worked hard since 2009 in developing my technical skills as a Wordpress web developer. I believe I have the aptitude, interest and discipline required for a course such as this. I am very interested in expanding into the cybersecurity and software development sectors.</p>

        <p>I attach my CV and look forward to hearing from you.</p>
